# Statistical-analysis-Between-Instant-Messages-and-Social-Relations

# Abstract
Since Social Network Service(SNS) and instant message(IM) have recently been used among most people,
many researchers have focused on the relationship between usage of SNS, IM, and social relations. In this
paper, following the trend, we investigate the relationship between the usage of SNS, IM, and intimacy. Especially, the number of Kakaotalk users has increased
worldwide. Thus, after collecting data from each of our
KakaoTalk chat rooms, we performed some preprocessing steps to extract several features we had defined. We
then tested 5 hypotheses by using these features and an
authoritative intimacy scale. Next, the analysis results
are provided with data visualizations. Finally, we discuss the analysis results and conclude the paper.

# Hypothesis
- Hypothesis 1 (H1): There is a significant difference in average length of message between private and public chat rooms.
- Hypothesis 2 (H2): There is a significant difference in the ratio of emojis between private and public chat rooms.
- Hypothesis 3 (H3): There is a significant positive correlation between the ratio of emoji usages and intimacy.
- Hypothesis 4 (H4): There is a significant positive correlation between the ratio of slang usages and intimacy.
- Hypothesis 5 (H5): There is a significant negative correlation between the balance of incoming and outgoing messages and intimacy.
